# Essentials
A tera-proxy module that automatically uses the items "Elite Everful Nostrum" and "Complete Crystal Bind" whenever needed.  
  
## Usage  
While ingame, open a whisper chat session with "!Essentials" by typing "/w !essentials" in chat and hitting the space bar.
This serves as the script's command interface. 
The following commands are supported:  
  
* on - Enables the script  
* off - Disables the script  
  
Any other input returns a summary of above commands in the game.
  
## Safety
Whatever you send to "!Essentials" ingame is intercepted client-side. The chat is NOT sent to the server.  
The script makes sure that you are not dead, mounted, in a battleground or in a negotiation before using an item.
